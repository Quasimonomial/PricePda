<p>Welcome to this site!  You're probably checking out my work.  Let me give you a brief explaination of this site.  The idea is that retailers can compare their prices to that of their major competitors.  The admins on keep track of the prices, products, and competitors they want to show.  There are tools that help this do this.  Logging in as just a guest or an account your create will show you the user side, where you can upload your prices and see them compared.</p>
